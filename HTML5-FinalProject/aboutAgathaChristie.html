    <h1>Agatha Christie: One of the Greatest Detective Novelists of All Time</h1>
    <p>Agatha Christie, the "Queen of Crime," was a British author renowned for her ingenious detective novels, short stories, and plays. Born in 1890, she created two of literature's most iconic sleuths—the meticulous Hercule Poirot and the sharp-witted Miss Marple. With intricate plots, shocking twists, and a keen understanding of human nature, her works have sold over two billion copies, making her the best-selling novelist of all time. Beyond mysteries, she also wrote romances under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott and crafted the world's longest-running play, The Mousetrap. Christie&#39;s legacy endures as a master of suspense whose stories continue to captivate readers worldwide.</p>
